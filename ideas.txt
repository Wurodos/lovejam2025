1. Action Programming
Core: puzzle, space-movement
Put cards with actions into slots, they'll execute sequentially

Boring, overdone

2. Preparations for Zero Player Game
 a) Roguelike. Hire dudes, equip items, but after that you can't control them
 Idk, I'm kinda making a similar game rn so don't want to reimplement it here again
 b) Dungeon builder, build dungeon and watch it be burned!
 I think there's a better option in 3.



3. CARCASSONE! BUT DUNGEON!
Basically carcassone, you build your roads/castles/fields/monasteries and score points
BUT THEN ORCS/GOBLINS/WHATEVER ARRIVE AND SMASH EVERYTHING IN THEIR WAY!
Everything that will remain after will score TRIPLE (no reducing points, that's gonna feel bad for the player)

We obviously remove other players and meeples. To still maintain decision space,
there'll be 2 tiles of choice every time
Maybe some negative tiles????? Idk we'll see later

Core loop:
Phase 1:
1) Get 2 tiles!
2) Pick a tile and put it! If not possible, discard
3) Score if finished road/monastery/city
Phase 2:
No player input, some fuckers arrive and obliterate Everything
Cities create friendly defence force and block other parts of the map with their walls
Monasteries heal nearby structures overtime but not themselves
Roads help friendly units arrive a lot faster
